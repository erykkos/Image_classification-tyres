# Image classification- tyres images

This is a project developed as a final project at the Data Science bootcamp organised by Sages.

The goal of the project was to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of distinguishing between good-quality and defective-quality tires. Subsequently, to test the model, a script was created to analyze a website with tire auctions. The script filters auctions, retaining only those representing good-quality tires. Therefore, the project was divided into two notebooks:

- CNN_1-model_selection.ipynb - model construction
- CNN_2-model_prediction.ipynb - using models to filter online auctions.
